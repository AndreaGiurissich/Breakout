# Java Breakout Clone ðŸŽ®

A simple Breakout clone built in Java, developed as a personal project following my university course in **Java Programming and Graphics Management**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This game is a classic implementation of Breakout using Java's Swing framework. It leverages a **CardLayout** for screen management and dynamically builds levels from matrices stored in `.txt` files, allowing for easy customization and level design.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Classic Breakout gameplay with ball, paddle, and bricks
- Multiple levels defined by external text files
- CardLayout-based screen navigation (e.g. main menu, game screen, game over)
- Simple and extensible code structure for learning and experimentation

## ðŸ§© Level Design

Levels are created using plain text files with matrices representing brick layouts. Each number corresponds to a different brick type or empty space.

Example (`level1.txt`):
